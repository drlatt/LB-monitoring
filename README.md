# LB-monitoring
test/assignment

Tasks:
1. Create a set of scripts/cookbooks/manifests/etc. that would fire up 3 virtual machines/containers of
your choice, with OS of your choice on AWS.
2. Make the first virtual machine a load balancer and monitoring node for the other 2 vm's. The
monitoring machine should monitor the installed services, availability of the machines themselves. The
flavor of the monitoring software does not matter.
3. Install on the other two vmâ€™s a web server of your choice which serves a text page with the machine
hostname in web root
4. Write a short explanation of your work and describe why you chose those specific technologies/tools
instead of others available
